* sulphur

=sulphur= extends =ert= with some simple mocking macros. The macros allow
you to mock any function and make assertions on what was (or wasn't)
called and with what arguments.

It grew out of my [[https://github.com/Walheimat/wal-emacs][configuration]] and therefore is currently still
heavily geared towards my usage. Setting up mocks itself is still a
bit cumbersome.

** Usage

You can add it as a dependency in your Cask file:

#+BEGIN_SRC Cask
(development
 ;; ... your other dependencies
 (depends-on "sulphur" :git "https://github.com/Walheimat/sulphur" :branch "trunk"))
#+END_SRC

** Usage

Please have a look, again, at my [[https://github.com/Walheimat/wal-emacs][configuration]] for usage examples
where it is still part of the main source code base.
